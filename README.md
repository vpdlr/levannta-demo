# Levannta Demo Project

This is a demo project for Levannta, built with Django and DRF. The project simulates the process of requesting an advance based on a subscription portfolio and includes the following functionality:

- Submit a portfolio of clients.
- Apply for a loan based on the portfolio.
- Retrieve the status of the loan application.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.x (or higher)
- pip (for managing dependencies)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vpdlr/levannta-demo.git
cd levannta_demo
```

###Â 2. Set up a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Start the development server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
The application will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Endpoints

- **state:** The status of the loan (APPROVED/REJECTED).
- **payment_schedule:** The repayment schedule for the loan.


### GET /api/advances/loan-status/{loan_id}/

## Technologies Used
- Django 5.1
- Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Pandas (for data processing and portfolio calculations)

## Assumptions

- Identifiers are used to support the management of multiple portfolios (companies) at the same time: Each portfolio submission returns a unique portfolio_id, loan applications require the associated portfolio_id and return a unique loan_id, the loan_id is used to fetch the loan status.
- The portfolio data should be provided in **CSV** format with the required headers.
- The repayment schedule is calculated using a factor rate of 1.2x the loan amount. The repayment period is fixed at 12 months.

## Technical decisions

### Data Processing with Pandas:

The use of Pandas simplifies processing portfolio data, allowing efficient calculation of metrics like average MRR and churn rate.

### DRF for API Development:

Django REST Framework provides a sustained structure for building the API endpoints.

### State Management:

Loans are tracked with states (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED), ensuring clarity in the application's workflow.
